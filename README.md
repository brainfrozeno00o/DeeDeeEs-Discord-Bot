# DeeDeeEs-Discord-Bot
Just a test Discord bot I'm doing for fun as I am trying to learn how to code bots in Python.

Please check out this [article](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/) for a quick reference.

**Pre-requisites in doing the code for the bot**

1) Installing the ```discord.py``` library via _pip_ with this command: ```pip install -U discord.py```.
2) Installing the ```dotenv``` library via _pip_ with this command: ```pip install -U python-dotenv```.
